FFParam is a Standalone python package for CHARMM force field parametrization including both the additive CGenFF/CHARMM36 and Classical Drude polarizable force fields. To assist in the parametrization process, the program is provided with a graphical user interface (GUI) and it is cross-platform. FFParam shields the user from labor-intensive manual work and shifts the focus towards the improvement and the quality of parameters.
